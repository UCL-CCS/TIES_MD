`TIES` is a collection of software packages which can be used to calculate protein ligand binding free energies with physics based alchemical methods. `TIES` stands for thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling and this method focuses on the use of ensemble simulations to control for the alleotoric errors in molecular dynamics simulations.

Within the `TIES` collection there are two packages: `TIES 20`, `TIES MD`. `TIES 20` can be used to build all input for `TIES MD`. `TIES MD` is an implementation of the `TIES` protocol that is built on `OpenMM` and `NAMD`. Please see our [documentation](https://UCL-CCS.github.io/TIES_MD/) for more information on `TIES MD` or our main [TIES](http://www.ties-service.org/) page for information on all packages.
